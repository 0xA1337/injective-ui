## Developer guide:

1. Create a new branch off of the master branch as to make your changes

2. Links different projects within the repo so they can import each other without having to publish anything to NPM

- `lerna boostrap`

3. Making changes to any of the packages
- Run `git add . && git commit -m 'commit message'` which will trigger the lint-staged and vitest yarn scripts [here](injective-ui/../.husky/pre-commit)
- Run `git push` to publish a new branch in the remote repository
- Create a PR to merge to master. Once approved, you can move on to step 4

4. Publishing the changes to npm

- `lerna version`
- `lerna publish from-package`
